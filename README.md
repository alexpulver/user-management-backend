# User management backend
The project implements a *user management backend* component that uses 
Amazon API Gateway, AWS Lambda and Amazon DynamoDB to provide basic 
CRUD operations for managing users. The project also includes a toolchain 
with continuous deployment pipeline and pull request validation build.

## Create a new repository from usermanagement-backend
This is optional for deploying the component to sandbox environment, but 
**required** for deploying the toolchain.

The instructions below use the usermanagement-backend repository.

## Create development environment
See [Getting Started With the AWS CDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/getting_started.html)
for additional details and prerequisites

### Clone the code
```bash
git clone https://github.com/alexpulver/usermanagement-backend
cd usermanagement-backend
```

### Create Python virtual environment and install the dependencies
```bash
python3.7 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# [Optional] Needed to upgrade dependencies and cleanup unused packages
# Pinning pip-tools to 6.4.0 and pip to 21.3.1 due to
# https://github.com/jazzband/pip-tools/issues/1576
pip install pip-tools==6.4.0
pip install pip==21.3.1

./scripts/install-deps.sh
./scripts/run-tests.sh
```

### [Optional] Upgrade AWS CDK Toolkit version
**Note:** If you are planning to upgrade dependencies, first push the upgraded AWS CDK Toolkit version.
See [(pipelines): Fail synth if pinned CDK CLI version is older than CDK library version](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/issues/15519) 
for more details.

```bash
vi package.json  # Update the "aws-cdk" package version
./scripts/install-deps.sh
./scripts/run-tests.sh
```

### [Optional] Upgrade dependencies (ordered by constraints)
Consider [AWS CDK Toolkit (CLI)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/reference.html#versioning) compatibility 
when upgrading AWS CDK packages version.

```bash
pip-compile --upgrade backend/api/runtime/requirements.in
pip-compile --upgrade requirements.in
pip-compile --upgrade requirements-dev.in
./scripts/install-deps.sh
# [Optional] Cleanup unused packages
pip-sync backend/api/runtime/requirements.txt requirements.txt requirements-dev.txt
./scripts/run-tests.sh
```

## Deploy the AWS Service Catalog AppRegistry application
[AWS Service Catalog AppRegistry](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicecatalog/latest/arguide/intro-app-registry.html)
allows to store your AWS applications, their associated resource collections, and 
application attribute groups. Application attribute groups define the context of 
your applications and resources.

The [operations.py](operations.py) module uses [Aspects](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/aspects.html) 
for adding operations capabilities to each stack. The `Metadata` operations capability 
defines AppRegistry [attribute group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicecatalog/latest/arguide/overview-appreg.html#attr-groups). 
The aspect needs AppRegistry [Application](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/@aws-cdk_aws-servicecatalogappregistry-alpha.Application.html) 
class instance to associate the attribute group. Since the aspect gets the node as the 
only parameter, it should reference the existing application. Currently, the 
`Application` class supports referencing an existing application using its ARN (using 
the [from_application_arn()](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/python/aws_cdk.aws_servicecatalogappregistry_alpha/Application.html#aws_cdk.aws_servicecatalogappregistry_alpha.Application.from_application_arn) 
method). Hence, you should deploy the AppRegistry application first, then store the 
application ARN value in the source code per instructions below.

```bash
npx cdk deploy ApplicationAssociatorStack
```
- Navigate to AWS Service Catalog AppRegistry console: https://REGION.console.aws.amazon.com/servicecatalog/home#applications/
- Open the `UserManagementBackend` application and copy the application ARN
- Update the `APPREGISTRY_APP_ARN` constant in [operations.py](operations.py)
- Commit and push the changes: `git commit -a -m 'Update AppRegistry app ARN' && git push`

## Deploy the component to sandbox environment
The `UserManagementBackendSandbox` stack uses your default AWS account and region. 

```bash
npx cdk deploy UserManagementBackendSandbox
```

Example output for `npx cdk deploy UserManagementBackendSandbox`:
```text
 âœ…  UserManagementBackendSandbox

Outputs:
UserManagementBackendSandbox.APIEndpoint = https://bsc9goldsa.execute-api.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/
```

## Deploy the toolchain

**Prerequisites**
- Create a new repository from usermanagement-backend, if you haven't done this already
- Create AWS CodeStar Connections [connection](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dtconsole/latest/userguide/welcome-connections.html)
  for continuous deployment
- Authorize AWS CodeBuild access for the pull request validation
  - Start creating a new project manually
  - Select GitHub as Source provider
  - Choose **Connect using OAuth**
  - Authorize access and cancel the project creation
- Update the toolchain account in [app.py](app.py) 
- Update the toolchain constants in [toolchain.py](toolchain.py)
- Commit and push the changes: `git commit -a -m 'Update toolchain account and constants' && git push`

```bash
npx cdk deploy UserManagementBackendToolchain
```

## Delete all stacks
**Do not forget to delete the stacks to avoid unexpected charges**
```bash
npx cdk destroy UserManagementBackendSandbox
npx cdk destroy UserManagementBackendToolchain
npx cdk destroy UserManagementBackendToolchain/ContinuousDeployment/Pipeline/Production/UserManagementBackendProduction
npx cdk destroy ApplicationAssociatorStack
```

Delete the AWS CodeStar Connections connection if it is no longer needed. Follow the instructions
in [Delete a connection](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dtconsole/latest/userguide/connections-delete.html).

## Testing the API
Below are examples that show the available resources and how to use them.

```bash
api_endpoint=$(aws cloudformation describe-stacks \
  --stack-name UserManagementBackendSandbox \
  --query 'Stacks[*].Outputs[?OutputKey==`APIEndpoint`].OutputValue' \
  --output text)

curl \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -X POST \
    -d '{"username":"john", "email":"john@example.com"}' \
    "${api_endpoint}/users"

curl \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -X GET \
    "${api_endpoint}/users/john"

curl \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -X PUT \
    -d '{"country":"US", "state":"WA"}' \
    "${api_endpoint}/users/john"

curl \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -X DELETE \
    "${api_endpoint}/users/john"
```
